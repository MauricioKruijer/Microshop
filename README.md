# Microshop
A tiny webshop

# Use composer to install all modules
composer install

# User NPM to install all modules needed for frontend
Goto webroot to run npm install (also triggers bower install)

# TODO
- Fix user session match with validation function in UserService
- Save order to database
- Make user accounts more fexible
- Support for full billing address
- Get more sleep
- Document code..
- Write unit tests..
- And so on so on

# Front end
- Prototype
  - Shopping cart is not persistent (contains bugs)
  - Add product with photo's should work
  - View products on front page should work
  - View product detail should work
- Located in webroot/app/index.html

# Backend prototype (instead of using cURL to test all features)
- No styling, not even a wireframe
- Available at root / (might have to use .htaccess)
- It is do-able :p
